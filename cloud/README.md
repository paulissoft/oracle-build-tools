# Oracle Cloud

## Introduction

Oracle provides since quite some years the [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).

You can use this document to:
1. set up an [OCI compute instance & autonomous free database](terraform/README.md)
2. do some [OCI management like connecting to an ADB or downloading a wallet](oci-management/README.md)
3. set up an [Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster](oke-cluster/README.md)

See the code and instructions in the folders below.

A lot can be set up for free but if you want to limit the budget on non-free cloud infrastructure, please read on...

## Spend zero 

Based on [Enforced budgets on OCI using functions and quotas](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/enforced-budgets-on-oci-using-functions-and-quotas).

Go to "Billing & Cost Management" to set up a budget.
