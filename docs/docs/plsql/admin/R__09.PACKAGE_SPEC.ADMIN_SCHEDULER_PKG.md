# Package "ADMIN_SCHEDULER_PKG"

This package contains various DBMS_SCHEDULER stop and drop routines that:
- will only work for the current session AND
- will really kill the attached job session as is not obvious when a session is waiting, for instance on DBMS_AQ.LISTEN.

The session user is the value of sys_context('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER').
The job session can be retrieved from:

```
select  r.session_id
from    all_scheduler_running_jobs r
where   r.owner = sys_context('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER')
and     r.job_name = p_job_name
``
